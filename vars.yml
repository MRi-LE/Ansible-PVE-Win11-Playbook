deploy_image: 'Windows Pro 11 N'
# Applicable 2025 options for deploy_image: 
#Windows 11 Home	For typical consumers / home users 
#Windows 11 Pro	For more advanced users, small businesses — adds networking, security, business features. 
#Windows 11 Pro for Workstations	For high-end workstations / power-users needing extra performance / hardware support. 
#Windows 11 Education	For schools / educational institutions / students. 
#Windows 11 Pro Education	Education-oriented but with Pro-level features (for institutions needing management/security + education licensing). 
#Windows 11 Enterprise	For large organizations / companies needing advanced management, security, and deployment tools. 
#Windows 11 SE	A lightweight version — aimed at low-cost / low-end devices, especially for education. 
#Windows 11 IoT Enterprise	For embedded devices / specialized “Internet of Things” (IoT) scenarios / industrial use. 
# The “N” editions (also “KN” for certain markets) are specially made versions that do not include media-related technologies. 
# In practice this means: no built-in media playback apps (no Windows Media Player, no built-in video/music apps, no preinstalled media codecs) by default. 
# Functionally: Aside from missing media features, an “N” edition behaves exactly like the non-N version
